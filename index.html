      <p>This was a group project with 7 other members where we to created a web application for our client, Omnistruct, using 
        Spring Security and SpringBoot with Java and SQL to maintain and provide secure services in the backend, and 
        using React, HTML, and Java for the frontend services. The official documentation provided by the Department of Defence was utilized in our web application
        to establish a standard process enabling contractors to perform a self-assessmnet and 
        confirm compliance to fundamental safeguarding requirements, using the Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS). </p>

        <p><i style="font-size:24px" class="fa">&#xf09b;</i> Github Link: <a href="https://github.com/csus-crist-cpe159-s23/project-flopos">FlopOS Link</a></p>
        <p>This was a group project with 2 other members where we applied operating system principles to design and implement a multitasking operating system which we called FlopOS. 
            The focus of our work revolved around essential subjects like process scheduling, resource control and allocation, and interfacing. The project was carried out in the SPEDE 
            environment, utilizing VIM and GitHub as key tools.

      <p>These projects were completed with 5 other team members where we implemented techniques for data analytics and mining including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, predictive model evaluation, 
        clustering, association rule mining, natural language processing, and other advanced data mining topics. We designed and implemented systems using contemporary data analysis and mining programming libraries to automate 
        pattern discovery and knowledge extraction on the most recent FDA Pharmaceutical Drugs list.
